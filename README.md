## Software used
Matlab 2012

## Theory
_Digital Image Processing_ - Rafael C Gonzalez, et al. [1]

# About the Projects
The projects concern about multiple processes. These are:

## Image enhancement
The process of manipulating an image so that the result is more suitable than the original for a specific application.

## Image restoration
Mathematical or probabilistic models of image degradation.

## Morphological processing
Deals with the tools for extracting image components that are useful in the representation and description of shape.

## Segmentation
Partitions an image into its constituent parts or objects.

## Representation and description
Usually is a raw pixel data, constituing either the boundary of a region, or all of the points in the region itself._
